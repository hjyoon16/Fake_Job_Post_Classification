. The purpose of this project is to construct an ideal model that has a predictability to
determine fraudulent job posts and thus to minimize the loss from job post frauds. A data set
from the public was obtained, analyzed, and processed to make it ideal for data mining. After
data processing, the set was split into training and test sets, and the training set was used to build
the model by applying it through five different algorithms: Na√Øve Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest
neighbors, random forest, and logistic regression. The five constructed models were then
compared with the test data set results, and each of them was validated by comparing evaluation
measurements.
